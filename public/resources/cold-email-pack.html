            <h3>How to Structure Your Prompts for Best Outcomes</h3>
            <p>
              To get the most out of these AI prompts, consider the following
              structure and best practices:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Define the AI's Role and Expertise:</strong> Clearly
                state who the AI is (e.g., "You are an expert B2B copywriter
                specializing in SaaS revenue optimization outreach.") and what
                its mission is. This sets the tone and focus for the AI's
                generation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Specify the Offer and Its Value:</strong> Provide
                detailed information about what you are offering, its core
                promise, target audience, and how it's positioned (e.g.,
                "Service: Free Revenue Leak Audit (Value: $2,500)").
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Set Clear Writing Guidelines:</strong> Include
                instructions on tone, length, and desired structure. This helps
                the AI produce content that aligns with your brand and
                objectives (e.g., "Tone: Expert consultant, data-driven,
                confident but not arrogant").
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Outline Personalization Requirements:</strong>
                Crucially, list the specific elements that need to be
                personalized. This guides the AI in incorporating
                prospect-specific data effectively (e.g., "Reference their
                company size/ARR range if available").
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Provide Comprehensive Lead Information (Variables):</strong
                >
                Use the provided variable placeholders and populate them with
                actual prospect data. The more detailed and accurate this
                information, the better the personalization (e.g., "Name:
                {{first_name}} {{last_name}}").
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Define the Desired Output Format:</strong> Clearly
                specify how you want the AI to present its response, often in a
                structured format like JSON, to make it easy to use (e.g.,
                "Output format: { "subject": "Your subject line here", "email":
                "Your complete email body here" }").
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Add Specific Instructions for AI Generation:</strong>
                Tell the AI exactly what you want it to generate (e.g.,
                "Generate a personalized cold email with: 1. Compelling subject
                line...").
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>What Kind of Data to Feed In to Get the Best Results</h3>
            <p>
              The quality of your output is directly proportional to the quality
              and relevance of the data you feed into the prompt. Here are the
              key types of data (in general) and why they are important for
              personalization prompts:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Basic Contact Information:</strong> Such as first name,
                last name, title, company name, industry, and company size.
                These allow for fundamental personalization, addressing the
                prospect and their company directly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Company-Specific Intelligence:</strong> Including recent
                news, challenges, funding information, competitive context,
                recent company news, developments, or LinkedIn activity. This is
                vital for deep personalization. Recent news, funding rounds,
                leadership changes, or challenges indicate timely reasons for
                outreach and allow you to tailor your message to their current
                situation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Industry and Business Model Specifics:</strong> Like
                industry, SaaS category, business model, product category,
                services offered, target market, and sales channels. This
                enables the AI to understand the context of the prospect's
                business and tailor examples, challenges, and benefits that are
                highly relevant to their specific industry or business model.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Financial/Size Metrics:</strong> Such as estimated ARR,
                annual revenue, monthly revenue, company size, team size, and
                growth stage. These metrics allow the AI to align the offer and
                messaging with the prospect's scale and likely pain points or
                opportunities. For example, a growth-stage SaaS company will
                have different needs than an early-stage one.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Offer Context:</strong> Details about the offer type,
                primary benefit, time sensitivity, offer value, main offer, and
                any available stories or case studies. Providing this ensures
                the AI correctly positions your solution and emphasizes the most
                compelling aspects.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Target-Specific Challenges/Pain Points:</strong>
                Explicitly stating known primary or recent challenges. This
                allows the AI to agitate these problems and position your offer
                as the solution.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              By meticulously preparing and feeding this data into the prompts,
              you can generate highly personalized, effective cold emails that
              resonate with your target audience.
